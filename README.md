# Splatong
Prototype of a crossover between Pong and Splatoon for Sega MegaDrive/Genesis.

Developed and compiled with the SGDK 1.12. Thanks and shout out to Stehane for the SDK : https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/wiki

This 3 days project took place during the Stunfest 2016 and the idea was to mock off Pong with a twist.
So after a few iterations I came with Splatong - a 2 players game where your goal is to catch the ball when it is the same color as you, and to avoid it when it's the other way around.
There are 4 portals, 2 blue and 2 orange, when the ball goes through one of those it takes the portal color.
Player 1 is orange whereas Player 2 is blue.

The ball bounces off the walls and increases in speed with time.
If you catch the ball with your paddle and it's the same color as yours, you gain 1 point.
On the contrary, if you catch a ball which color is your opponent's one, you lose 3 points.

It's a prototype/party version so code is ugly, bugs are numerous and gameplay is far from being refined.

Cheers.
